# Twelve-Step-Study-Guide

I'm an alcoholic and my name's Dave.  I created this 12 step study guide **not** because I'm anybody great, **not** because I'm some respected teacher of the twelve steps.
I put this together because I spend 2 1/2 years failing to work the steps. Now, I didn't drink, but I also receieved none of the gifts of the program. I was basically a dry drunk
and that's *no way* to work this program at all!

I created just in case I forget why I'm in this fellowship and what it would cost me if I decided I could do this *all on my own*. If this benefits you as well, *great*.
In keeping with the traditions of A.A, only my first name will be listed, I will *never* try to publish this professionally, no matter how good I think this might be.
This will stay free and available on this page.

Feel free to read this, and if it helps you, pass it on. It's ok to clone this, print this, share this, pass it on to your sponsees too! If it keeps you sober, it's good!
