# Step 1. "We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable"



## \*A.  We admitted we were powerless over _____________ \*

[Webster's dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/powerless) defines **powerless**  as "lacking the authority or capacity to act" or "devoid of stength or 
resources to act". That certainly describes me when it comes to alcohol or internet porn (my two drugs of choice). If I take a drink, I don't have the capacity to not
have the next drink, I can't leave that glass half finished, I need to drink it all. I can't even understand half a drink, that makes no sense to me whatsoever.

I don't need to have gone to jail, gone to the nut house or been homeless to be powerless. I just have to be able to **not** have one drink. That's it. It doesn't matter if I 
have that kind of power with everything else in my life. It doesn't matter that I go to church, or don't go to church at all,it doesn't matter if I'm the CEO of a major
corporation or an entry level worker, it doesn't even matter if I have a job or not. The only thing that matters is that I can't have *just one* drink and not think about having
more, or worse yet not have the desire to have more.

Normal people don't drink that way. They can have half a drink and forget about it, or want to stop if they feel the alcohol affect them. They don't have an obsession to have 
the next drink, and the next one after that, and so on. Once I have that first drink, I'm powerless. I *have* to finish that drink and have the next one. When it comes 
to alcohol, *I AM powerless*.

## \*B.  That our lives had become unmanageable\*

When I was really new in the program, I asked one of the old timers how to tell if my life was unmanageable, because, in truth, I thought I managed quite well. I had a roof
over my head, I had a job, I never worked hung-over, like some of the old-timers talked about, nor was I ever homeless, nor was I ever committed to a nuthouse.  The old timer
gave me a knowing smile and told me that if I couldn't handle life without booze, it was unmanageable.
